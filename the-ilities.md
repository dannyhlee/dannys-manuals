## -ilities to business concerns
Referencing: Mark Richards. [Software Architecture Monday, Lesson 37 - Translating Quality Attributes to Business Concerns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP9Q9dpTomA)

### Non-functional Quality Attributes (aka architectural characteristics)
- adaptability - 
- agility - how quickly we can change to adapt to market needs / the ability respond quicklly to change
- availability - doesnt go down often
- deployability - low risk of breaking something on deployment, how fast or frequently we can deploy new features
- extensibility - api layers and open systems
- fault-tolerance - system keeps working even in face of failure
- interoperability - can interopt with mergers and acquisitions (standards based)
- learnability - simplicity, documentation to make system learnable
- modularity
- performance - faster applications
- recoverability
- scalability - can we scale our systems to support higher loads, or scale down to save costs
- security
- testability - ease of testing, completeness of testing, reduces bugs

### Business Concerns
- user-satistfaction -> performance -> availability -> fault tolerance -> testability -> agility
- time-to market -> agility -> testablity -> deployability
- competitive advantage -> agility -> testability -> deployability -> scalability -> availability -> fault tolerance -> adaptabilty
- regulatory compliance
- mergers and acquisitions -> agility -> scalability -> learnability -> interoperability -> extensibility -> adaptability
